Product Management System
Overview
The Product Management System is a web application designed to manage and display products using constructor functions. This project demonstrates the application of JavaScript constructor functions to create and manage product data dynamically. The application features two main pages: the Product Page and the Admin Page, both designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features
Product Page
Product Display: Products are displayed in a responsive grid format, ensuring a clean and organized layout.
Real-time Updates: Products are displayed in real-time based on the data stored in the browser's local storage.
Sold Status Toggle: Users can toggle the "Sold" status of a product. The status changes between "Yes" and "No" with each click.
Remove Product: Users can remove products from the list, and the changes are immediately reflected in the UI.
Admin Page
Product Management: Provides administrative functionality to manage product entries.
Data Handling: Allows for CRUD operations on the product data stored in the browser's local storage.
